    <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Peter Morgante, I am a Computer Programming student from Canada. The purpose of this site is a little dip into who I am. Below you'll find my likes, dislikes, interests and many more!</p>
    <p>Growing up I have always loved computers and programming. Through highschool I took as many computer courses as I could, I was able to learn about multiple languages like: java, python, and C++, and my love for coding/programming grew further. Coming into college I took a different program at first; Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering only scractched the surface of porgramming and mainly focused on physical component of computers like elctrical engineering. Through some difficulties and challenges I worked through the computer engineering course, but quickly realised it wasnt for me. After 2 years I decided to take one semester off to develop myself, before going back to school in January to start my new and current porgram; Computer programming and analysis. I am very excited for what this program has waiting for me!</p>
    <p>During my time in computer engineering and this course I changed alot; my likes and interests changing along with me. Looking back on how I was in highschool, I am easily able to tell I am far different. Below you may find a link to all of my favourite foods and movies; to help get to know me better</p>
